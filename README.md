# CampusOrbit - Seamless Event Coordination

Introducing **CampusOrbit**, a comprehensive platform designed to streamline campus event planning, registration, and ticket booking. Developed as part of our final year group project, I played a key role as the architect, designing a modern user interface with a focus on user experience. The system is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and follows the agile Scrum methodology for efficient development.

**Skills:** _Figma · UI/UX · React.js · MongoDB · Node.js · Express.js · Requirements Analysis · User Interface Design_

## Features

- View the event calendar
- Get event approval
- Ticket booking for events
- QR code generation for ticket reception

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- MongoDB Database

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory using two terminal tabs:
   - **cd client** - For the frontend
   - **cd api** - For the backend
3. Install server dependencies for both the frontend and backend.
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and replace placeholders with your values.
5. Start the server:
   - **ems/api:** `nodemon start`
   - If the command doesn't work, use: `PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass nodemon` to start the server.
6. Start the Client:
   - **ems/client:** `npm run dev`

The application should now be running. Access it at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

The server will be running on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
